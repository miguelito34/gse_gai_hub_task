A Perspective on K-12 AI Education,"Nathan Wang, Paul Tonko, Nikil Ragav, Michael Chungyoun, Jonathan Plucker",01/2023,arXiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.03217,"Artificial intelligence (AI), which enables machines to learn to perform a task by training on diverse datasets, is one of the most revolutionary developments in scientific history. Although AI and especially deep learning is relatively new, it has already had transformative impact on medicine, biology, transportation, entertainment, and beyond. As AI changes our daily lives at an increasingly fast pace, we are challenged with preparing our society for an AI-driven future. To this end, a critical step is to ensure an AI-ready workforce through education. Advocates of beginning instruction of AI basics at the K-12 level typically note benefits to the workforce, economy, and national security. In this complementary perspective, we discuss why learning AI is beneficial for motivating students and promoting creative thinking, and how to develop a module-based approach that optimizes learning outcomes. We hope to excite and engage more members of the education community to join the effort to advance K-12 AI education in the USA and worldwide.","Teaching – Instructional Materials, Teaching – Professional Learning","Educator, School Leader",High School (9-12),"Outcomes – Other Academic, Outcomes – Differentiation, Outcomes – Durable Skills, Reimagined Schooling",Descriptive – Product Development

This study evaluates OpenAI o1-preview's ability to perform higher-order cognitive tasks across 14 dimensions, including critical thinking, systems thinking, computational thinking, design thinking, metacognition, data literacy, creative thinking, abstract reasoning, quantitative reasoning, logical reasoning, analogical reasoning, and scientific reasoning. We used validated instruments like the Ennis-Weir Critical Thinking Essay Test and the Biological Systems Thinking Test to compare the o1-preview's performance with human performance systematically. Our findings reveal that o1-preview outperforms humans in most categories, achieving 150% better results in systems thinking, computational thinking, data literacy, creative thinking, scientific reasoning, and abstract reasoning. However, compared to humans, it underperforms by around 25% in logical reasoning, critical thinking, and quantitative reasoning. In analogical reasoning, both o1-preview and humans achieved perfect scores. Despite these strengths, the o1-preview shows limitations in abstract reasoning, where human psychology students outperform it, highlighting the continued importance of human oversight in tasks requiring high-level abstraction. These results have significant educational implications, suggesting a shift toward developing human skills that complement AI, such as creativity, abstract reasoning, and critical thinking. This study emphasizes the transformative potential of AI in education and calls for a recalibration of educational goals, teaching methods, and curricula to align with an AI-driven world.","Teaching – Instructional Materials, Teaching – Assessment and Feedback, Learning – Student Support",Educator,"Elementary (PK5), Middle School (6-8), High School (9-12), Post-Secondary","Outcomes – Other Academic, Outcomes – Durable Skills",Systematic Review

AI and personalized learning: Bridging the gap with modern educational goals,"Kristjan-Julius Laak, Jaan Aru",04/2024,arXiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02798,"Personalized learning (PL) aspires to provide an alternative to the one-size-fits-all approach in education. Technology-based PL solutions have shown notable effectiveness in enhancing learning performance. However, their alignment with the broader goals of modern education is inconsistent across technologies and research areas. In this paper, we examine the characteristics of AI-driven PL solutions in light of the OECD Learning Compass 2030 goals. Our analysis indicates a gap between the objectives of modern education and the current direction of PL. We identify areas where most present-day PL technologies could better embrace essential elements of contemporary education, such as collaboration, cognitive engagement, and the development of general competencies. While the present PL solutions are instrumental in aiding learning processes, the PL envisioned by educational experts extends beyond simple technological tools and requires a holistic change in the educational system. Finally, we explore the potential of large language models, such as ChatGPT, and propose a hybrid model that blends artificial intelligence with a collaborative, teacher-facilitated approach to personalized learning.","Teaching – Instructional Materials, Teaching – Assessment and Feedback, Teaching – Professional Learning, Learning – Student Support, Communicating / Social Tools",Educator,"Elementary (PK5), Middle School (6-8), High School (9-12), Post-Secondary, Adult","Efficiency, Outcomes – Other Academic, Outcomes – Social Emotional, Outcomes – Durable Skills",Systematic Review

Education systems now need to train students at the K-12 level to live in a society where they must interact with AI. Thus, AI literacy is a pedagogical and cognitive challenge at the K-12 level. This study aimed to understand how AI is being integrated into K-12 education worldwide. We conducted a search process following the systematic literature review method using Scopus. 179 documents were reviewed, and two broad groups of AI literacy approaches were identified, namely learning experience and theoretical perspective. The first group covered experiences in learning technical, conceptual and applied skills in a particular domain of interest. The second group revealed that significant efforts are being made to design models that frame AI literacy proposals. There were hardly any experiences that assessed whether students understood AI concepts after the learning experience. Little attention has been paid to the undesirable consequences of an indiscriminate and insufficiently thought-out application of AI. A competency framework is required to guide the didactic proposals designed by educational institutions and define a curriculum reflecting the sequence and academic continuity, which should be modular, personalized and adjusted to the conditions of the schools. Finally, AI literacy can be leveraged to enhance the learning of disciplinary core subjects by integrating AI into the teaching process of those subjects, provided the curriculum is co-designed with teachers.","Teaching – Instructional Materials, Teaching – Professional Learning, Analyzing","Educator, School Leader","Elementary (PK5), Middle School (6-8), High School (9-12)","Outcomes – Other Academic, Outcomes – Durable Skills, Reimagined Schooling",Systematic Review

However, there are fewer relevant evaluations and applications for primary school students. All innovation efforts in learning are directed at improving the quality of education by creating an active learning atmosphere for students. Students’ participation in the teaching-learning process can be improved by selecting appropriate learning materials suitable to the student’s learning style. The research aims to develop and measure the impact of an Artificial-Intelligence (AI)-based learning style prediction model in an online learning portal for primary school students. The subjects were recruited from Indonesian primary school students in grades 4 to 6. To fulfill the principle of personalized learning, the AI model in the online learning portal was designed to recommend learning materials that suit students’ learning styles. We formulated a new AI approach that enables collaborative filtering-based AI models to be driven by learning style prediction. With this AI algorithm, the online learning portal can provide material recommendations tailored specifically to the learning style of each student. The AI model performance test achieved satisfactory results, with an average RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) of 0.9035 from a rating scale of 1 to 5. Moreover, students’ learning performance was improved based on the results of t-test analysis on 269 subjects between the pre-test and post-test scores.","Teaching – Instructional Materials, Learning – Student Support",Educator,Elementary (PK5),"Efficiency, Outcomes – Differentiation, Reimagined Schooling",Descriptive – Implementation and Use

Applying IRT to Distinguish Between Human and Generative AI Responses to Multiple-Choice Assessments,"Alona Strugatski, Giora Alexandron",11/2024,arXiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02713,"Generative AI is transforming the educational landscape, raising significant concerns about cheating. Despite the widespread use of multiple-choice questions in assessments, the detection of AI cheating in MCQ-based tests has been almost unexplored, in contrast to the focus on detecting AI-cheating on text-rich student outputs. In this paper, we propose a method based on the application of Item Response Theory to address this gap. Our approach operates on the assumption that artificial and human intelligence exhibit different response patterns, with AI cheating manifesting as deviations from the expected patterns of human responses. These deviations are modeled using Person-Fit Statistics. We demonstrate that this method effectively highlights the differences between human responses and those generated by premium versions of leading chatbots (ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini), but that it is also sensitive to the amount of AI cheating in the data. Furthermore, we show that the chatbots differ in their reasoning profiles.

The first technology is a fully automated evaluation system that provides instantaneous scores and feedback. The second one uses human graders as an additional resource to enhance grading and feedback quality in aspects in which the automated system arguably falls short. Both technologies significantly improved students' essay scores in a large college admission exam, and the addition of human graders did not improve effectiveness in spite of increasing perceived feedback quality. Both technologies also similarly helped teachers engage more frequently on personal discussions on essay quality with their students. Taken together, these results indicate that teachers' task composition shifted toward nonroutine activities and this helped circumvent some of the limitations of artificial intelligence.

However, a key remaining question is how generative AI affects learning, namely, how humans acquire new skills as they perform tasks. This kind of skill learning is critical to long-term productivity gains, especially in domains where generative AI is fallible and human experts must check its outputs. We study the impact of generative AI, specifically OpenAI's GPT-4, on human learning in the context of math classes at a high school. In a field experiment involving nearly a thousand students, we have deployed and evaluated two GPT based tutors, one that mimics a standard ChatGPT interface (called GPT Base) and one with prompts designed to safeguard learning (called GPT Tutor). These tutors comprise about 15% of the curriculum in each of three grades. Consistent with prior work, our results show that access to GPT-4 significantly improves performance (48% improvement for GPT Base and 127% for GPT Tutor). However, we additionally find that when access is subsequently taken away, students actually perform worse than those who never had access (17% reduction for GPT Base). That is, access to GPT-4 can harm educational outcomes. These negative learning effects are largely mitigated by the safeguards included in GPT Tutor. Our results suggest that students attempt to use GPT-4 as a ""crutch"" during practice problem sessions, and when successful, perform worse on their own.

We argue that this instructor-driven approach has the potential to democratize the development of educational technology by enabling individual instructors to create AI exercises and tools tailored to their students' needs. While the exercises in this paper are a starting point, not a definitive solutions, they demonstrate AI's potential to expand what is possible in teaching and learning.","Teaching – Instructional Materials, Teaching – Assessment and Feedback, Teaching – Professional Learning, Learning – Student Support, Communicating / Social Tools",Educator,"Elementary (PK5), Middle School (6-8), High School (9-12), Post-Secondary","Outcomes – Differentiation, Outcomes – Durable Skills","Descriptive – Implementation and Use, Descriptive – Product Development"

Is ChatGPT Massively Used by Students Nowadays? A Survey on the Use of Large Language Models such as ChatGPT in Educational Settings,"Jérémie Sublime, Ilaria Renna",12/2024,arXiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17486,"The rapid adoption of Generative AI (GenAI) based on Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT has recently and profoundly impacted education, offering transformative opportunities while raising significant concerns. In this study we present the results of a survey that investigates how 395 students aged 13 to 25 years old in France and Italy integrate LLMs into their educational routines. Key findings include the widespread use of these tools across all age groups and disciplines, with older students and male students demonstrating higher usage frequencies, particularly in scientific contexts. The results also show gender disparities, raising concerns about an emerging AI literacy and technological gender gap. Additionally, while most students utilise LLMs constructively, the lack of systematic proofreading and critical evaluation among younger users suggests potential risks to cognitive skills development, including critical thinking and foundational knowledge. The survey results underscore the need for educational institutions to adapt their curricula to integrate AI tools effectively, promoting ethical use, critical thinking, and awareness of AI limitations and environmental costs. This paper provides actionable recommendations for fostering equitable and effective cohabitation of LLMs and education while addressing emerging challenges.","Teaching – Instructional Materials, Teaching – Assessment and Feedback, Learning – Student Support",Student,"Middle School (6-8), High School (9-12), Post-Secondary","Efficiency, Outcomes – Literacy, Outcomes – Other Academic",Descriptive – Implementation and Use
LearnLM: Improving Gemini for Learning,"LearnLM Team, Google",12/2024,arXiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16429,"Today's generative AI systems are tuned to present information by default rather than engage users in service of learning as a human tutor would. To address the wide range of potential education use cases for these systems, we reframe the challenge of injecting pedagogical behavior as one of \textit{pedagogical instruction following}, where training and evaluation examples include system-level instructions describing the specific pedagogy attributes present or desired in subsequent model turns. This framing avoids committing our models to any particular definition of pedagogy, and instead allows teachers or developers to specify desired model behavior. It also clears a path to improving Gemini models for learning -- by enabling the addition of our pedagogical data to post-training mixtures -- alongside their rapidly expanding set of capabilities. Both represent important changes from our initial tech report. We show how training with pedagogical instruction following produces a LearnLM model (available on Google AI Studio) that is preferred substantially by expert raters across a diverse set of learning scenarios, with average preference strengths of 31\% over GPT-4o, 11\% over Claude 3.5, and 13\% over the Gemini 1.5 Pro model LearnLM was based on.","Teaching – Instructional Materials, Teaching – Assessment and Feedback, Learning – Student Support",Student,"Elementary (PK5), Middle School (6-8), High School (9-12), Post-Secondary, Adult","Outcomes – Other Academic, Outcomes – Differentiation","Descriptive – Product Development, Impact – Quasi–experimental"

The system learns, from large-scale data of prior students, which assistance action to give for each of thousands of questions, to maximize measures of student learning outcomes. Using data from over 190,000 students in an online Biology course, we quantify the impact of different assistance actions for each question on a variety of outcomes (e.g., response correctness, practice completion), framing the machine learning task as a multi-armed bandit problem. We study relationships among different measures of learning outcomes, leading us to design an algorithm that for each question decides on the most suitable assistance policy training objective to optimize central target measures. We evaluate the trained policy for providing assistance actions, comparing it to a randomized assistance policy in live use with over 20,000 students, showing significant improvements resulting from the system’s ability to learn to teach better based on data from earlier students in the course. We discuss our design process and challenges we faced when fielding data-driven technology, providing insights to designers of future learning systems.","Teaching – Instructional Materials, Learning – Student Support",Student,High School (9-12),Efficiency,Impact – Randomized Controlled Trial

Math Education with Large Language Models: Peril or Promise?,"Harsh Kumar, David M. Rothschild, Daniel G. Goldstein, Jake M. Hofman",11/2023,SSRN,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4641653,"The widespread availability of large language models (LLMs) has provoked both fear and excitement in the domain of education. On one hand, there is the concern that students will offload their coursework to LLMs, limiting what they themselves learn. On the other hand, there is the hope that LLMs might serve as scalable, personalized tutors. Here we conduct a large, pre-registered experiment involving 1200 participants to investigate how exposure to LLM-based explanations affect learning. In the experiment's learning phase, we gave participants practice problems and manipulated two key factors in a between-participants design: first, whether they were required to attempt a problem before or after seeing the correct answer, and second, whether participants were shown only the answer or were also exposed to an LLM-generated explanation of the answer. Subsequently, all participants were tested on new test questions to assess how well they had learned the underlying concepts. Overall we found that LLM-based explanations positively impacted learning relative to seeing only correct answers. The benefits were largest for those who attempted problems on their own first before consulting LLM explanations, but surprisingly this trend held even for those participants who were exposed to LLM explanations before attempting to solve practice problems on their own. An accompanying qualitative analysis revealed that these boosts in performance were indeed due to participants adopting the strategies they were shown, and that exposure to LLM explanations increased the amount people felt they learned and decreased the perceived difficulty of the test problems.","Teaching – Assessment and Feedback, Learning – Student Support","Student, Educator",High School (9-12),"Outcomes – Numeracy, Outcomes – Differentiation",Impact – Randomized Controlled Trial

"Questioning the Scope of AI Standardization in Learning, Education, and Training","Jon Mason, Bruce E. Peoples, Jaeho Lee",01/2020,IEEE,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10258062,"Well-defined terminology and scope are essential in formal standardization work. In the broad domain of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) the necessity is even more so due to proliferation and appropriation of terms from other fields and public discourse - the term ‘smart’ is a classic example; as is ‘deep learning’. In reviewing the emerging impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on the field of Information Technology for Learning, Education, and Training (ITLET), this paper highlights several questions that might assist in developing scope statements of new work items. While learners and teachers are very much foregrounded in past and present standardization efforts in ITLET, little attention has been placed until recently on whether these learners and teachers are necessarily human. Now that AI is a hot spot of innovation it is receiving considerable attention from standardization bodies such as ISO/IEC, IEEE and pan-European initiatives such as the Next Generation Internet. Thus, terminology such as ‘blended learning’ necessarily now spans not just humans in a mix of online and offline learning, but also mixed reality and AI paradigms, developed to assist human learners in environments such as Adaptive Instructional Systems (AIS) that extend the scope and design of a learning experience where a symbiosis is formed between humans and AI. Although the fields of LET and AI may utilize similar terms, the language of AI is mathematics and terms can mean different things in each field. Nonetheless, in ‘symbiotic learning’ contexts where an AIS at times replaces a human teacher, a symbiosis between the human learner and the AIS occurs in such a way where both can exist as teacher and learner. While human ethics and values are preeminent in this new symbiosis, a shift towards a new ‘intelligence nexus’ is signalled where ethics and values can also apply to AI in learning, education, and training (LET) contexts.

Realizing Visual Question Answering for Education: GPT-4V as a Multimodal AI,"Gyeong-Geon Lee, Xiaoming Zhai",05/2024,arXiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07163,"Educational scholars have analyzed various image data acquired from teaching and learning situations, such as photos that shows classroom dynamics, students' drawings with regard to the learning content, textbook illustrations, etc. Unquestioningly, most qualitative analysis of and explanation on image data have been conducted by human researchers, without machine-based automation. It was partially because most image processing artificial intelligence models were not accessible to general educational scholars or explainable due to their complex deep neural network architecture. However, the recent development of Visual Question Answering (VQA) techniques is accomplishing usable visual language models, which receive from the user a question about the given image and returns an answer, both in natural language. Particularly, GPT-4V released by OpenAI, has wide opened the state-of-the-art visual langauge model service so that VQA could be used for a variety of purposes. However, VQA and GPT-4V have not yet been applied to educational studies much. In this position paper, we suggest that GPT-4V contributes to realizing VQA for education. By 'realizing' VQA, we denote two meanings: (1) GPT-4V realizes the utilization of VQA techniques by any educational scholars without technical/accessibility barrier, and (2) GPT-4V makes educational scholars realize the usefulness of VQA to educational research. Given these, this paper aims to introduce VQA for educational studies so that it provides a milestone for educational research methodology. In this paper, chapter II reviews the development of VQA techniques, which primes with the release of GPT-4V. Chapter III reviews the use of image analysis in educational studies. Chapter IV demonstrates how GPT-4V can be used for each research usage reviewed in Chapter III, with operating prompts provided. Finally, chapter V discusses the future implications.","Teaching – Instructional Materials, Teaching – Assessment and Feedback, Analyzing",Educator,"Elementary (PK5), Middle School (6-8), High School (9-12), Post-Secondary, Adult","Efficiency, Outcomes – Other Academic, Outcomes – Differentiation","Descriptive – Implementation and Use, Systematic Review"

Machine learning is increasingly included in computing curricula in higher education, and a quickly growing number of initiatives are expanding it in K-12 computing education, too. As machine learning enters K-12 computing education, understanding how intuition and agency in the context of such systems is developed becomes a key research area. But as schools and teachers are already struggling with integrating traditional computational thinking and traditional artificial intelligence into school curricula, understanding the challenges behind teaching machine learning in K-12 is an even more daunting challenge for computing education research. Despite the central position of machine learning and AI in the field of modern computing, the computing education research body of literature contains remarkably few studies of how people learn to train, test, improve, and deploy machine learning systems.

The Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Students' Learning Experience,"Potter Kaledio, Abill Robert, Louis Frank",02/2024,SSRN,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4716747,"The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in education has the potential to revolutionize the learning experience for students. This abstract provides an overview of the impact of AI on students' learning experience, highlighting its benefits and potential challenges.AI technologies such as machine learning, natural language processing, and data analytics have been increasingly adopted in educational settings. These technologies enable personalized and adaptive learning experiences, providing students with tailored content and feedback based on their individual needs and learning styles. AI-powered educational platforms can analyze vast amounts of data to identify patterns and offer personalized recommendations, thereby enhancing students' engagement and motivation.One of the significant benefits of AI in education is its ability to provide immediate and constructive feedback to students. Automated grading systems powered by AI algorithms can assess and provide feedback on assignments, quizzes, and exams promptly, allowing students to understand their strengths and weaknesses in real-time. This timely feedback facilitates self-reflection and enables students to make necessary improvements, leading to enhanced learning outcomes.Furthermore, AI can support collaborative learning environments. Intelligent tutoring systems and virtual learning assistants can facilitate group discussions, provide guidance, and foster collaboration among students. These AI-powered tools can promote active participation, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills, creating a dynamic learning environment that mirrors real-world scenarios.However, the integration of AI in education also poses challenges that need to be addressed. Privacy and ethical concerns arise when dealing with student data, as AI relies on collecting and analyzing personal information to provide personalized experiences. Safeguarding student data privacy and ensuring ethical use of AI technologies are essential considerations for educators and policymakers.Additionally, there is a potential risk of over-reliance on AI technologies, leading to a passive learning experience for students.

Towards Educator-Driven Tutor Authoring: Generative AI Approaches for Creating Intelligent Tutor Interfaces,"Tommaso Calo, Christopher J.

Existing approaches overcome the programming limitations with no-code authoring through drag and drop, however they assume that educators possess the necessary skills to design effective and engaging tutor interfaces. To address this assumption we introduce generative AI capabilities to assist educators in creating tutor interfaces that meet their needs while adhering to design principles. Our approach leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and prompt engineering to generate tutor layout and contents based on high-level requirements provided by educators as inputs. However, to allow them to actively participate in the design process, rather than relying entirely on AI-generated solutions, we allow generation both at the entire interface level and at the individual component level. The former provides educators with a complete interface that can be refined using direct manipulation, while the latter offers the ability to create specific elements to be added to the tutor interface. A small-scale comparison shows the potential of our approach to enhance the efficiency of tutor interface design.

Recent advances in generative AI (gen AI) have created excitement about the potential of new technologies to offer a personal tutor for every learner and a teaching assistant for every teacher. The full extent of this dream, however, has not yet materialised. We argue that this is primarily due to the difficulties with verbalising pedagogical intuitions into gen AI prompts and the lack of good evaluation practices, reinforced by the challenges in defining excellent pedagogy. Here we present our work collaborating with learners and educators to translate high level principles from learning science into a pragmatic set of seven diverse educational benchmarks, spanning quantitative, qualitative, automatic and human evaluations; and to develop a new set of fine-tuning datasets to improve the pedagogical capabilities of Gemini, introducing LearnLM-Tutor. Our evaluations show that LearnLM-Tutor is consistently preferred over a prompt tuned Gemini by educators and learners on a number of pedagogical dimensions. We hope that this work can serve as a first step towards developing a comprehensive educational evaluation framework, and that this can enable rapid progress within the AI and EdTech communities towards maximising the positive impact of gen AI in education.","Teaching – Instructional Materials, Teaching – Assessment and Feedback, Learning – Student Support","Student, Educator","Elementary (PK5), Middle School (6-8), High School (9-12), Post-Secondary, Adult","Efficiency, Outcomes – Other Academic, Outcomes – Differentiation","Descriptive – Product Development, Impact – Quasi–experimental"
Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence in Education: Pitfalls and Pathways,Nathalie A. Smuha,12/2020,SSRN,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3742421,"Across the world, Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications are entering all domains of our lives, including the educational environment. This development was further spurred by the COVID-19 pandemic, which rendered many educational institutions dependent on (AI-enabled) digital learning tools to continue their activities. While the use of AI systems can lead to numerous benefits, it can also entail ethical risks, which are increasingly appearing on legislators’ agendas. Many of these risks are context-specific and increase in significance when vulnerable individuals are involved, asymmetries of power exist, or human rights and democratic values are at stake more generally. Surprisingly, however, regulators have thus far paid only little attention to the specific risks arising in the context of Artificial Intelligence in education (AIED). This paper hence aims to assess the ethical challenges posed by AIED. Its normative framework consists of the seven requirements for Trustworthy AI, as set out in the Ethics Guidelines of the European Commission’s High-Level Expert Group on AI. After an overview of the broader context in which these requirements took shape (Section 2), the paper examines each requirement in the educational realm, as well as the pitfalls that should be addressed to enable their realisation (Section 3). Particular attention is given to the special role of education in shaping people’s minds, and the manner in which this role can be used both to empower and exploit individuals. The paper notes that AIED’s main strengths – offering education on a wider scale, through more flexible and individualised learning methods, and through the closer monitoring of students’ reception of the materials – are also its main liabilities when left unchecked. Finally, the paper discusses various pathways that policymakers should consider to foster Trustworthy AIED beyond the adoption of guidelines (Section 4), before concluding (Section 5).","Teaching – Instructional Materials, Teaching – Assessment and Feedback, Teaching – Professional Learning, Learning – Student Support, Communicating / Social Tools, Analyzing","Student, Educator, School Leader","Elementary (PK5), Middle School (6-8), High School (9-12), Post-Secondary, Adult","Efficiency, Outcomes – Other Academic, Outcomes – Differentiation, Outcomes – Social Emotional, Outcomes – Durable Skills",Systematic Review
Tuning Music Education: AI-Powered Personalization in Learning Music,"Mayank Sanganeria, Rohan Gala",12/2024,arXiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13514,"Recent AI-driven step-function advances in several longstanding problems in music technology are opening up new avenues to create the next generation of music education tools. Creating personalized, engaging, and effective learning experiences are continuously evolving challenges in music education. Here we present two case studies using such advances in music technology to address these challenges. In our first case study we showcase an application that uses Automatic Chord Recognition to generate personalized exercises from audio tracks, connecting traditional ear training with real-world musical contexts. In the second case study we prototype adaptive piano method books that use Automatic Music Transcription to generate exercises at different skill levels while retaining a close connection to musical interests. These applications demonstrate how recent AI developments can democratize access to high-quality music education and promote rich interaction with music in the age of generative AI. We hope this work inspires other efforts in the community, aimed at removing barriers to access to high-quality music education and fostering human participation in musical expression.","Teaching – Instructional Materials, Learning – Student Support","Student, Educator","High School (9-12), Post-Secondary, Adult","Efficiency, Outcomes – Differentiation",Descriptive – Product Development
Tutor CoPilot: A Human-AI Approach for Scaling Real-Time Expertise,"Rose E. Wang, Ana T. Ribeiro, Carly D. Robinson, Susanna Loeb, Dorottya Demszky",10/2024,EdWorkingPapers.com,https://edworkingpapers.com/ai24-1054,"Generative AI, particularly Language Models (LMs), has the potential to transform real-world domains with societal impact, particularly where access to experts is limited. For example, in education, training novice educators with expert guidance is important for effectiveness but expensive, creating significant barriers to improving education quality at scale. This challenge disproportionately hurts students from under-served communities, who stand to gain the most from high-quality education and are most likely to be taught by inexperienced educators. We introduce Tutor CoPilot, a novel Human-AI approach that leverages a model of expert thinking to provide expert-like guidance to tutors as they tutor. This study presents the first randomized controlled trial of a Human-AI system in live tutoring, involving 900 tutors and 1,800 K-12 students from historically under-served communities. Following a preregistered analysis plan, we find that students working on mathematics with tutors randomly assigned to have access to Tutor CoPilot are 4 percentage points (p.p.) more likely to master topics (p<0.01). Notably, students of lower-rated tutors experienced the greatest benefit, improving mastery by 9 p.p. relative to the control group. We find that Tutor CoPilot costs only $20 per-tutor annually, based on the tutors’ usage during the study. We analyze 550,000+ messages using classifiers to identify pedagogical strategies, and find that tutors with access to Tutor CoPilot are more likely to use strategies that foster student understanding (e.g., asking guiding questions) and less likely to give away the answer to the student, aligning with high-quality teaching practices. Tutor interviews qualitatively highlight how Tutor CoPilot’s guidance helps them to respond to student needs, though tutors flag common issues in Tutor CoPilot, such as generating suggestions that are not grade-level appropriate. Altogether, our study of Tutor CoPilot demonstrates how Human-AI systems can scale expertise in real-world domains, bridge gaps in skills and create a future where high-quality education is accessible to all students.","Teaching – Professional Learning, Learning – Student Support",Educator,"Elementary (PK5), Middle School (6-8)","Efficiency, Outcomes – Other Academic",Impact – Randomized Controlled Trial

Using ChatGPT for Science Learning: A Study on Pre-service Teachers' Lesson Planning,"Gyeong-Geon Lee, Xiaoming Zhai",05/2024,IEEE,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10531039,"While ongoing efforts have continuously emphasized the integration of ChatGPT with science teaching and learning, there are limited empirical studies exploring its actual utility in the classroom. This study aims to fill this gap by analyzing the lesson plans developed by 29 pre-service elementary teachers and assessing how they integrated ChatGPT into science learning activities. We first examined how ChatGPT was integrated with the subject domains, teaching methods/strategies, and then evaluated the lesson plans using a generative artificial intelligence (AI)-technological pedagogical and content knowledge (TPACK)-based rubric. We further examined pre-service teachers' perceptions and concerns about integrating ChatGPT into science learning. Results show a diverse number of ChatGPT applications in different science domains—e.g., Biology (9/29), Chemistry (7/29), and Earth Science (7/29). A total of 14 types of teaching methods/strategies were identified in the lesson plans. On average, the pre-service teachers' lesson plans scored high on the modified TPACK-based rubric (M = 3.29; SD = 0.91; on a 1–4 scale), indicating a reasonable envisage of integrating ChatGPT into science learning, particularly in “instructional strategies and ChatGPT” (M = 3.48; SD = 0.99). However, they scored relatively lower on exploiting ChatGPT's functions toward its full potential (M = 3.00; SD = 0.93), compared to other aspects. We also identified several inappropriate use cases of ChatGPT in lesson planning (e.g., as a source of hallucinated Internet material and technically unsupported visual guidance). Pre-service teachers anticipated ChatGPT to afford high-quality questioning, self-directed learning, individualized learning support, and formative assessment. Meanwhile, they also expressed concerns about its accuracy and the risks that students may be overly dependent on ChatGPT. They further suggested solutions to systemizing classroom dynamics between teachers and students.
